<h1>BO NICOLAISENS DANSEORKESTER</h1>
<h3>Anger is an Energy</h3>
<p>The definitive autobiography of John Lydon, one of the most recognizable icons in the annals of music history. As Johnny Rotten, he was the lead singer of the Sex Pistols - the world's most notorious band, who shot to fame in the 70'ties with singles such as 'Anarchy in the UK' and 'God Save the Queen'.</p>

<p>Via music and invective he spearheaded a generation of young people across the world who were clamouring for change - and found it in style and attitude of this most unlikely figurehead.</p>

<h3>Rage In Control</h3>
<p>Public Image Ltd Lydon expressed an equally urgent impulse in his make-up - the constant need to reinvent himself. From their beginnings in 1978 he set the template for a band that continues to challenge and thrive in the 2010s.</p>

<p>He also found time for making innovative new dance records with the likes of Afrika Baambaata and Leftfield.</p>

<h3>Get Me Out of Here!</h3>
<p>Following the release of a solo record in 1997, John took a sabbatical from his music career into other media, most memorably his own Rotten TV show for VH1 and as the most outrageous contestant ever on I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!</p>
<p>He then fronted the Megabugsseries and one-off nature documentaries and even turned his hand to a series of much loved TV advertisements for Country Life butter.</p>
